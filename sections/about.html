    <h2>About me</h2>

    <section class="parrafo">
      <p>
        Cira Valenzuela started performing since she was 5yrs old as a dancer.
        She fell in love with acting when she joined theater at Clark High
        School at the age of 16yrs. Since she has attended coaching seminars
        with Casting Directors Lisa London, Michael Tesla, Helen McCready, Susan
        Putnam, Andy Hendy, etc. Cira has also done stunt training mainly on
        high falls and choreographed combat training.
      </p>
      <p class="parrafito">
        Ms. Valenzuela has appeared in films such as Attack of the Unknown, Aidy
        Kaine, Last Round, Station to Station, and Harlee’s Roses. Cira has been
        apart of several commercials and ad campaigns. What’s next for her to
        tackle? Well she is now also getting into furthering her creativity and
        write her own short film so say tuned. howcases of unknown writers
        Off-Off-Broadway.
      </p>

      <div class="box-tres">

          Include indie films and appearances on primetime or daytime TV or
          include all major stage credits from Off-Off-Broadway to Broadway.
          Your credits tell them how to cast you and what roles you are
          consistently hired to play. Don’t include background work—it's not
          considered a professional credit if you’re standing in the background.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="box-cuatro">
        <p>
          Here, write about your interests, skills, travel, languages, or
          musical instruments—anything that makes you memorable. Elaborate don’t
          just list. Here are some examples of closing statements. You want to
          leave them with a powerful professional memory of you. Weak example:
          “I want to thank my cat, my roommate Diana, and my Mom for believing
          in me.” (This gives the impression that you’re still a beginner. Save
          the gratitude for your acceptance speech at the Oscars). Strong
          example: “Looking forward to working in the next Emmy Award USA series
          or in any feature opposite Johnny Depp!” (Industry professionals will
          remember you as an actor who knows where you’re going!) Let your bio
          jumpstart your career even when you’re not there to audition!
